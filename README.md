This is me trying to learn simple CRUD with prisma and mysql

<!-- Database -->

What u need to do is just type in terminal :

    npx prisma migrate dev

And its recomended to input some data into Brand table

<!-- For .env file -->

Just fill it with something like this example :

    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"

<!-- How its looks -->
